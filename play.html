              _The Diabolical Circle_ is reprinted by special permission of Professor
              Franz Rickaby, in whose course in dramatic composition (English 36) in
              the University of North Dakota this play was written. For permission to
              perform, address Professor Franz Rickaby, University of North Dakota,
              Universty, North Dakota.

          <p> Beulah Bornstead, one of the promising young playwrights of the
              Northwest, was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, May 5, 1896. She has
              had her academic training at the University of North Dakota, from which
              she received her B.A. in 1921. At present Miss Bornstead is principal of
              the Cavalier High School, North Dakota. Before attempting drama she
              tried her hand at journalism and at short-story writing.
          </p>
  
          <p> Miss Bornstead was introduced into playwriting by Professor Franz
              Rickaby, in whose course in dramatic composition at the University of
              North Dakota _The Diabolical Circle_ was written. In speaking of this
              play Miss Bornstead writes: "_The Diabolical Circle_ is the first play I
              have ever written. I never enjoyed doing anything so much in my life.
              The characters were so real to me that if I had bumped into one going
              round the corner I should not have been surprised in the least. BETTY
              and CHARLES and ADONIJAH and even COTTON MATHER himself worked that play
              out. All the humble author did was to set it down on paper." _The
              Diabolical Circle_ was produced May 5, 1921, by the Dakota Playmakers in
              their Little Theatre at the University of North Dakota.

              _The Diabolical Circle_ is one of the best contemporary plays dealing
              with American historical material. Its characterization is one of its
              noteworthy elements.

          <p>
              THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE
  
  
              SCENE: _The living-room in the Mather home in Boston._
  
               TIME: _About 1700, an evening in early autumn._
  
              _The stage represents the living-room of the Mather home. A large
              colonial fireplace is seen down-stage left, within which stand huge
              brass andirons. To one side hangs the bellows, with the tongs near
              by, while above, underneath the mantelpiece, is suspended an old
              flint-lock rifle. On both ends of the mantel are brass
              candlesticks, and hanging directly above is an old-fashioned
              portrait of Betty's mother. There are two doors, one leading into
              the hall at centre left, the other, communicating with the rest of
              the house, up-stage right. A straight high-backed settee is
              down-stage right, while in the centre back towers an old
              grandfather's clock.[K] To the left of the clock is the window,
              cross-barred and draped with flowered chintz. An old-fashioned
              table occupies the corner between the window and the hall door.
              Here and there are various straight-backed chairs of Dutch origin.
              Rag rugs cover the floor._
          </p>
          <p>
              As the curtain rises_ COTTON MATHER _is seated in a large armchair
              by the fire, with_ BETTY _on a stool at his feet, with her
              knitting_.
          </p>
  
          <p>  COTTON, _his hair already touched with the whitening frost of many
              a severe New England winter, is grave and sedate. Very much
              exercised with the perils of this life, and serenely contemplative
              of the life to come, he takes himself and the world about him very
              seriously._
  
               _Not so with_ MISTRESS BETTY. _Outwardly demure, yet inwardly
               rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times, she
              dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
              provocation._
  
               _As we first see them_ COTTON _is giving_ BETTY _some timely
              advice_.
  
          </p>
          <p>
              COTTON. But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
              reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
              fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
               BETTY. [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
              [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.
          </p>
          <p>
              COTTON. [_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
              It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.
          </p>
          <p>
              BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
              yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.
          </p>
  
          <p> COTTON. Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
              _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
              for we know not what a day may bring forth.
          </p>
          <p>
  
              BETTY. [_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
              Perhaps----
          </p>
          <p>
  
              COTTON. Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
              be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
              I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
              go.
          </p>
          <p>
              BETTY. [_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
              prithee; I have no fears.
          </p>
  
          <p>   COTTON. [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
              There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
              at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
              point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
              difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
              sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
              propounded to thee much that I ought.
          </p>
          <p>
              BETTY. In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
              fitting and proper for a maiden to know?
          </p>
          <p>
              COTTON. [_Perplexed._] I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
              not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
              married estate.
          </p>
          <p>
              BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
              estate.
          </p>
          <p>
  
              COTTON. It is time.
          </p>
          <p>
              BETTY. [_Mockingly pleading._] Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
              forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither----
          </p>
          <p>
  
               COTTON. [_Interrupting sternly._] Betty! It ill befitteth a daughter of
               mine to quote the Scriptures with such seeming irreverence.--I would not
               be parted from thee, yet I would that thou wert promised to some godly
               and upright soul that would guide thee yet more surely in the paths of
               righteousness. There be many such.
          </p>
           <p>
  
               BETTY. Yea, too many.
          </p>
          <p>
               COTTON. What meanest thou?
